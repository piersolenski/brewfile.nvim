# üç∫ brewfile.nvim

Manage your [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) [Brewfile](https://docs.brew.sh/Brew-Bundle-and-Brewfile) directly from Neovim!  

If you're on macOS and use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (and let's be honest, who doesn't?), you probably have a [Brewfile](https://docs.brew.sh/Brew-Bundle-and-Brewfile) to manage your packages declaratively. `brewfile.nvim` lets you manage your Brewfile without ever leaving the editor!

## ‚ú® Features

- **Install/uninstall packages** - Just position your cursor on any line in your Brewfile and hit your keybind  
- **Auto-dumps Brewfile after changes** - Keeps your Brewfile in sync automatically  
- **Package info** - Get detailed package information
- **Safety first** - Optional confirmation prompts for destructive actions  

## üì¶ Package Support

This plugin supports managing packages from a variety of sources:

- **Homebrew**: Standard `brew` packages.
- **Cask**: `cask` packages for GUI applications.
- **Mac App Store**: `mas` packages for App Store applications (Requires [mas-cli](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas)).
- **VSCode**: `vscode` extensions (Requires [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
