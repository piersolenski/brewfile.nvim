# üç∫ brewfile.nvim

If you're on macOS and use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you probably have a [Brewfile](https://docs.brew.sh/Brew-Bundle-and-Brewfile) to manage your packages declaratively. `brewfile.nvim` lets you manage your that Brewfile from within your favourite editor, giving you even less reasons to leave Vim or go outside. Why get Vitamin D when you can be installing and uninstalling apps, casks, and extensions at blazingly fast speeds?

## ‚ú® Features

- **Install/uninstall packages** - Just position your cursor on any line in your Brewfile and hit your keybind  
- **Auto-dumps Brewfile after changes** - Keeps your Brewfile in sync automatically  
- **Package info** - Get detailed package information
- **Safety first** - Optional confirmation prompts for destructive actions
