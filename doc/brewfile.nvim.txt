If you’re on macOS and use Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>, you probably have a
Brewfile <https://docs.brew.sh/Brew-Bundle-and-Brewfile> to manage your
packages declaratively. `brewfile.nvim` lets you manage your that Brewfile from
within your favourite editor, giving you even less reasons to leave Vim or go
outside. Why get Vitamin D when you can be installing and uninstalling apps,
casks, and extensions at blazingly fast speeds?


FEATURES                                *brewfile.nvim-brewfile.nvim-features*

- **Install/uninstall packages** - Just position your cursor on any line in your Brewfile and hit your keybind
- **Auto-dumps Brewfile after changes** - Keeps your Brewfile in sync automatically
- **Package info** - Get detailed package information
- **Safety first** - Optional confirmation prompts for destructive actions
